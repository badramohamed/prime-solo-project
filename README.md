## Description 

As an avid reader and book geek, I decided to create a website where you can view books and descriptions. The application will include numerous components that will assist you in selecting the best book for yourself. You can also send book recommendations to friends through the app, which is a great way to connect with your friends over your favorite books. Tools like ratings and easy access are also excellent ways to keep track of what you want to read and complete.
